# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe — Prompt Engineered Edition

Welcome to **Tic Tac Toe**, a sleek and animated two-player game built entirely through **prompt engineering** with the help of Microsoft Copilot. This project showcases how natural language prompts can be used to design, develop, and refine interactive web experiences — no traditional IDE required.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Turn-based gameplay for two players (X and O)
- 🎯 Win detection with animated victory line
- 🎉 Pop-up message celebrating the winner
- 🖌️ SVG-rendered Xs and Os with smooth animations
- 🔁 Reset button to start a new game instantly
- 💡 Clean and responsive layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 🚀 How It Works

- The game board is a 3×3 grid rendered dynamically in the browser.
- Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their symbol.
- After each move, the game checks for a winner.
- If a player wins, a green line is drawn across the winning combination and a congratulatory message appears.
- The game can be reset at any time using the **Reset Game** button.

## 🧠 Built with Prompt Engineering

This project was created entirely through **prompt engineering** — a process where code, logic, and design were generated iteratively by interacting with an AI assistant. Every function, animation, and style was crafted through conversational refinement rather than manual coding alone.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — structure
- **CSS3** — styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — game logic and interactivity
- **SVG** — animated rendering of game symbols and victory lines

## 📦 Setup
